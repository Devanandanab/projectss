    <h1> MICROCONTROLLER</h1>
    <P>microcontroller (MCU) is a tiny, self-contained computer on a single integrated circuit chip. It contains a processor, memory, and input/output (I/O) peripherals, allowing it to control specific functions within an embedded system. Unlike general-purpose microprocessors, microcontrollers are designed for specific tasks and often include features like timers, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), and serial communication interfaces.Â </P>
